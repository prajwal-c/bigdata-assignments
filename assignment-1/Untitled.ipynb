What it does is, It stores that value at some memory location and then binds that variable name to that memory container. And makes the contents of the container accessible through that variable name. So the data type does not matter. As it will get to know the type of the value at run-time."

    "Ans:\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "1. **Beginner-Friendly** - Python is an excellent platform for beginners who want to step into coding. This programming language is easy to learn, understand and code as it does not include too many technicalities.\n",
    "2. **Large Community** - The Python community boasts many coders, developers, professionals, and students on the same platform, helping one another and bringing the best out of it. \n",
    "3. **Flexible and Extensible** - Python is extremely flexible and can be extended to other languages. Developers can write code in C  and C++ and build new features in the dynamically-typed language.\n",
    "4. **Extensive Libraries** - Python features an extensive set of libraries and contains code for various purposes like documentation-generation, regular expressions, web-browsers, unit-testing, CGI, databases, image manipulation, etc. Hence, it eliminates the need to write the complete code manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "1. **Slower than Compiled Languages** - Python is slow compared to other non-compiled languages as it requires a lot of computational power. So, this is the thing that you need to look at before choosing Python.\n",
    "2. **Python’s Memory Consumption and Garbage Collection** - Python language comes with high memory usage, and the high memory consumption should be tackled carefully during the project. It uses reference counting in its garbage collection, which often leads to potential memory losses.\n",
    "3. **Issues with Design** - Python developers sometimes have to deal with complicated designs. Therefore, highly efficient and experienced developers are preferred over beginners.\n",
    "4. **Python is Dynamically Typed** - Developers working in Data Science and Machine Learning projects prefer statically-typed language over dynamically typed language. The reason is that the statically typed language potentially minimizes a lot of errors and bugs in the system."

   "source": [
    "Ans:\n",
    "1. **Data Science** - Python is an entrusted language for scientific computing tasks, including analysis and visualization of large data sets. The use cases of Python in data science stems from the large and active ecosystem of third-party packages such as numpy, pandas, Sci-kit etc....\n",
    "2. **Automation** - Automating repetitive tasks such as sending emails & voicemails, organizing files & folders, launching programs, filling out forms, etc. can be automated through scripting.\n",
    "3. **Application Development** - Python is a favourable choice for web application development. Python integrates well with other programming languages and has some amazing web frameworks that boost the application development cycle that include django, flask etc.....\n",
    "4. **AI & Machine Learning** - Python’s pre-built libraries are the reason why it is preferred for AI & machine learning development.\n",
    "5. **Audio/Video Applications** - Python is a sought-after programming language for creating audio/video applications. An example of this is the Spotify app that’s built using Python programming language."
